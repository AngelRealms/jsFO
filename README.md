# jsFO
jsFO is an open-source port of Interplay's Fallout2 to the browser.
jsFO is written in Javascript, using the HTML5 canvas API for rendering, and is compatible with all modern browsers. jsFO uses a python based backend for conversion from Fallout's native file formats to browser compatible JSON files.
At present time of writing, jsFO is in a pre-alpha, limitedly playable state.
